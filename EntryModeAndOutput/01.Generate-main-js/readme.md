Run the build command from `package.json` to use webpack.

```bash
npm run build
```

---

By default (without any additional configuration) webpack will look for `src` folder and file `index.js`. And the output by default will be `dist` folder with `main.js` file.

In this demo only the mode is specified, which is `development`.
