## Plugins

Plugins are javascript modules that are used to customize and extend the functionality of the Webpack module bundler. Plugins can be used to perform various tasks during the compilation process, such as optimizing the output, generating new files, injecting code into the output, and much more.

Plugins are typically defined as objects with one or more hooks, which are functions that are called by the Webpack compiler at various stages during the build process. These hooks allow plugins to interact with the compiler and modify the behavior of the build.
